## Installation

The `apigee-127` module is designed for Node.js and is available through npm:

`npm install -g apigee-127`

The `-g` option automatically places the `a127` command-line commands in you PATH. If you do not use `-g`, then you need to add the `apigee-127/bin `directory to your PATH manually. 

Typically, the `-g` option places modules in: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/apigee-127`.
